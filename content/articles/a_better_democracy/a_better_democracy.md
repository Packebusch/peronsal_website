According to current forecasts, the AfD, a protest party, is at 35% in Saxony and would be the strongest force. According to Statista, 69% of all respondents in spring 2023 said they "tend not to trust" political parties. Populists are skilfully exploiting this fact. In short: "The system is corrupt and "those at the top" don't care about you. Vote for us, because everything will be better with us." The whole thing is emphasised with fear-mongering rhetoric and leads to a nationwide shift to the right. So there are two options: Either you vote for the "alternative" populists or you vote for "business as usual!" from the various "old parties". Both paths either stagnate in the status quo, in democratisation or even curtail democracy. What if we had a third choice? An option that brings more democracy, not less? 

## Elections and parties - the centrepiece of every democracy?

Elections have become synonymous with democracy. The instrument of elections is even explicitly mentioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and "fair elections" are the litmus test for any democracy anywhere in the world. Why is that so? Bernard Manin wrote as early as 1995 in his critique of representative democracy - "Current democratic systems have emerged from a political order that was conceived by its founders as an alternative to democracy." After the great revolutions in the 18th century, when the great constitutions were created, the revolutionaries, who mainly came from the well-off middle classes, wanted to secure their newly won power against the old nobility, but also against the common people. The elected representatives were to be the best and most deserving men in the country. This created an aristocracy that was explicitly not intended to represent and reflect the wider society, but rather the elite. Only this time it is not an inherited aristocracy but an elected one. This is most evident in the United States, where there are veritable political dynasties and more than half of the senators are millionaires. 

If elections are an aristocratic instrument rather than a democratic one, what could a more democratic system look like? 

## The democratic alternative

Although there are historical forms of democracy, for example in ancient Athens, that can be used for inspiration, it is worth starting from First Principles.If you had the task today of designing a democratic system that is both efficient and legitimate, would you really send people to a polling station every four years with a piece of paper, where they put their cross next to a name or a party that has been hysterically reported on for months? Let's give it a try: 

What functions are there in the political establishment today? Simplified:
- The Council of Elders sets the agenda that the Bundestag deals with
- Lobby organisations exert (non-transparent) influence and can provide input from outside. 
- The specialised committees and ministries draw up legislative proposals in cooperation with experts
- The Bundestag (possibly also the Bundesrat) votes on these
- The Constitutional Court monitors compliance with the Basic Law
- The Bundestag can pass amendments to the legislative process

These functions are carried out by elected representatives who belong to a party.

We want a democratic system, by the people, for the people. So in our sketch, we replace each function with a council of randomly selected people who are representative of our society. What would the system look like then? How would it work? Terry Bouricius, a former American politician and researcher, asked himself the same question. His proposal addresses the individual functions in detail and can serve as a blueprint for a better, more legitimate and more efficient democracy. 

Unless otherwise stated, all councils consist of participants drawn by lot from a pool of volunteers. The work in the councils lasts for 3 years, is rotated every third of the year and is remunerated appropriately.  
- The **Agenda Council** sets the agenda. As before, it can be influenced by petitions. 
- The **Interest Panels** are transparent lobby groups that can provide input on current legislative issues. 
- Legislative proposals are drafted in the **Review Councils**. These are most similar to modern citizens' councils. As today, this is done in co-operation with experts. 
- The legislative proposals are passed in the **Jury Council**. This council is only drawn by lot from all citizens on the occasion of a vote on a legislative proposal. Participation is remunerated and is mandatory. The council is representative.The law is presented by neutral employees of the administration and voted on within one or more days, depending on its scope. 
- The **Council of Rules** decides on the rules and procedures of legislative work. 
- The **Supervisory Council** monitors the legislative process and deals with complaints.  
In this model, every current function is performed, but transparently and by representatively and randomly selected citizens. They are supported in their work by administrative staff, assistants and experts. 

## What happens next? 

There are many unanswered questions in the model. It is unusual for us to think about a democracy that is not based on elections. I would like to answer a few questions below.

*"What's so bad about professional politicians? At least they know their stuff"* 

Career politicians are susceptible to lobby groups, they only represent a small part of the population, they have to fight for power to get power, which leads to party infighting. It's more about re-election, their own profile or the party than about the welfare of the citizens. And no, most MPs are not experts in the areas in which they later work. That's exactly why they have experts and staff at their side. 

*"But can Mrs Gruselsky from the bakery really draft laws? That's super complicated!"* 

Definitely, government work is not easy. That's exactly why citizens' assemblies are highly structured and supplemented with experts. Just like the subcommittees are also staffed with experts. I am firmly convinced that the citizens chosen, regardless of their background, will take this task seriously and serve their country to the best of their knowledge and belief. 

There are many more questions that need to be answered. Not everything is already clear or defined. One thing is clear: our current system is not made for the challenges of our time. Let's try to find answers together and create a better democratic system.

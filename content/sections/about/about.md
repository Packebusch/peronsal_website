I'm a product leader trying to make our everyday mobility more sustainable. As much as I love technology and being able to code and fiddle around, I believe that the answers to our most pressing problems are more to be found in **social technologies**. We need to change the way we live and work together and most importantly, how we interact with the world.  

I think about **Democracy** a lot. I believe our multi party system is deeply flawed and that we need to trancend it into a multi body system out of several randomly elected citizen councils. You can read more humble thoughts about that in my writing or in the books of David Van Reybrouck or Bernard Manin. 

I love to read. If you have good book recommendation, don't hesitate to reach out! Sometimes I consult companies on Product Management or on Process Automatisation via Low Code Platforms. Feel free to reach out for that as well.
